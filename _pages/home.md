Welcome to my website! This is where I post information about my projects and technical experience.

I am a 3rd year Computing Science Specialization student at the University of Alberta. My primary interests are embedded development, robotics (especially autonomous robotics), and DevOps. I am currently a Software Co-Lead for the [Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project](/experience/arvp) club, and a [research assistant] in the Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging.

Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, camping, biking, and gardening.

You can check out my resume and some of my projects below!
