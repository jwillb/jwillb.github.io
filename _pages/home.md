Welcome to my website! This is where I post information about my projects and technical experience.

I am a 3rd year Computing Science Specialization student at the University of Alberta. My primary interests are embedded development, robotics (especially autonomous robotics), and DevOps. I am currently a Software Co-Lead for the [Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project](/experience/arvp) club, and a [teaching assistant](/experience/teaching-assistant) for CMPUT 201.

Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, camping, and mycology.
