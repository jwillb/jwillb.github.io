I joined [ARVP](https://arvp.org){:target="_blank"} in September of 2024, but I didn't really get involved with the club until January of 2025. I regret joining later, because ARVP has been an incredible experience. ARVP is a robotics club at the University of Alberta whose current focus is developing robots to compete in the annual RoboSub competition in California. This is where I worked on my [visual servo project](/projects/visual-servo), and implemented some bug fixes in the simulator using C++. I was selected to go to RoboSub 2025 along with some other members of the team, and I had a blast. I made many meaningful connections, had lots of fun, and learned more about how robots work.

I was elected to run ARVP's software subteam after returning from RoboSub. Along with my Co-Lead, Yousef, I am responsible for deciding how the robots should function, what sensors they need, and communicating with the electrical and mechanical teams to ensure the robots' subsystems integrate properly and perform to our standard.
