I joined ARVP in September of 2024, but I didn't really get involved with the club until January of 2025. I regret joining later, because ARVP has been an incredible experience. ARVP is a robotics club at the University of Alberta whose current focus is developing robots to compete in the annual RoboSub competition in California.
