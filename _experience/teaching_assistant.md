I am currently a teaching assistant for the CMPUT 201 class at the University of Alberta. The title of this class is "Practical Programming Methodology" and it focuses on fundamental software development skills such as memory management and using the terminal. This class is taught using the C programming language and the Linux terminal. My responsibilities are running lab demonstration sessions to gauge student performance, fine-tuning assignments before they're released, and helping students solve complex issues in their code at office hours.
