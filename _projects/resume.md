## Background
When I first created my resume, I used Google Docs. This was fine for the first few years that I was working. By the second year of university I realised I needed something that was more deterministic to use, and I learned that many people used LaTeX for their resumes. I found this exciting because it was a way to declare your resume and know exactly how it was set up. With a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor, there is a lot of dragging and dropping and cursing when your columns don't like up. Not so with LaTeX: It is a markup language for declaring your documents! I instantly knew I wanted my resume in this format. The unfortunate thing is that the most popular editor for LaTeX, Overleaf, is proprietary, online only software. I decided to use TeXMaker instead, which allowed me to edit locally. This was a good workflow. The final issue was a simple one on the surface: How do I get my resume into a central place, with revision history to see what changes I've made? If you know about Git, then you know it is the right choice.
